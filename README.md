# Usage
1. Put in your database credentials in credentials.json.default and rename it to credentials.json
2. Execute controller.py using python 3.4 (x32) :)


# Known Bugs
- When saving, there will be a blank row between all rows (in the saved CSV File)
- When a file has blank rows, nothing will be displayed (interacts with the first bug)

# ToDo
- Merging the database into the TableModel
- Undo/Redo History
